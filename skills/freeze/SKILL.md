# Freeze -- Session-Scoped Edit Guard

Blocks Write and Edit operations on files outside the specified directories. Use when reviewing code (freeze everything except notes), when writing (freeze `explorations/`), or when editing data pipelines (freeze `data/raw/`).

## Usage

```
/freeze explorations/       # Only allow edits in explorations/
/freeze data/raw/ talks/    # Only allow edits in data/raw/ and talks/
/freeze off                 # Deactivate all freeze guards
```

## How It Works

1. Parse the directory arguments from the user's input
2. Write the guard configuration to `.claude/state/session-guards.json`
3. The `session-guard` PreToolUse hook reads this file and blocks Edit/Write operations on files outside the allowed directories
4. Report what's frozen and what's editable

## Activation

When the user invokes `/freeze [dirs]`:

1. Read the current `.claude/state/session-guards.json` (create if it doesn't exist)
2. Set the `freeze` guard:
```json
{
  "freeze": {
    "active": true,
    "allowed_paths": ["explorations/", "data/raw/"],
    "activated_at": "2026-05-09T14:30:00",
    "reason": "User invoked /freeze"
  }
}
```
3. Confirm: "Freeze active. Edits allowed only in: [dirs]. Run `/freeze off` to deactivate."

## Deactivation

When the user invokes `/freeze off`:

1. Read `.claude/state/session-guards.json`
2. Set `freeze.active` to `false`
3. Confirm: "Freeze deactivated. All paths editable."

## Gotchas

- Freeze is session-scoped -- it resets when the conversation ends
- The guard file persists on disk; the hook reads `.claude/state/session-guards.json` on every PreToolUse
- `.claude/` is always editable (can't freeze yourself out of config changes)
- Paths are relative to the project root
